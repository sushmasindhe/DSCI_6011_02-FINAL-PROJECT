# Project: Drowsiness Detection System
## Overview:
A drowsiness detection system is a technology that monitors a person's level of alertness during activities like driving. It uses sensors to track indicators such as eye movements, facial expressions, and steering behavior. Machine learning algorithms analyze this data to detect signs of drowsiness, triggering alerts to the driver to prevent accidents.

## Project Components:
1.Dataset:
we have taken our dataset from kaggle
2.Image Processing
3.Splitting the data
4.Data Augmentation
5.Deep Learning Models
Process (step by step):
The implementation is done on Kaggle platform.

Importing all necessary libraries and modules.

Importing the dataset by accessing the link.

Converting images into dataframes.

Train-test splitting of the dataframes.

Training the models.

Evaluation of models by calculating the Accuracy, precision, recall.

Conclusion:
In summary, drowsiness detection systems offer a proactive solution to the dangers of drowsy driving by leveraging advanced technologies. Through real-time monitoring and timely interventions, these systems enhance road safety and save lives. With ongoing advancements and collaborative efforts, they hold the potential to significantly reduce accidents caused by driver fatigue, making roads safer for everyone.
