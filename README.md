# Project: Drowsiness Detection System
## Overview:
The goal of the Drowsiness Detection System project is to address the growing issue of drowsy driving, a risky phenomena that puts road safety at serious risk all over the world. When someone drives when tired or drowsy, it hinders their ability to stay awake and respond rapidly to changing road conditions. This is known as drowsy driving. The goal of this research is to create a system that can identify driver drowsiness in real time, preventing accidents and maybe saving lives.
## process
### 1.Loading Data And Libraries

### 2.Image Processing
 our preprocessing will includeÂ¶
 Detecting faces from images
 Drawing landmarks on our images to increase performance
 Resizing our images
 LabelEncoding
 Image Augmantation

### 3. Splitting and testing the data 

### 4.Deep Learning Models:
we use Batch Normalization

### 5.Evaluation of models by calculating the Accuracy, precision, recall for Classification task and Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error for Regression task.

### 6.Conclusion:
In conclusion, our method of detecting driver fatigue with CNNs and facial landmark detection offers a workable solution to enhance traffic safety. By accurately classifying drivers into "Active" and "Fatigue" stages based on facial expressions, our technology addresses a significant issue in real-time. It performs better than traditional methods and sends timely alerts to drivers and car monitoring systems, according to extensive testing. It might have major consequences for industry and society, possibly even saving lives and preventing accidents. Further research could focus on enhancing the model architecture, including additional functionalities, and optimizing deployment in real-world driving scenarios. Collaboration with stakeholders and regulatory bodies will be crucial for broader adoption. Our study basically shows the ground-breaking potential of AI-driven solutions in addressing
